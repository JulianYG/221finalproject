Newspaper GAL: Newspaper Generation and Analysis of Leaning
This project is about finding news articles that help people see the opposite side of their point of views. Very helpful for expanding horizon and critical thinking, I like it. 

"LETS NOT PUT LABELS ON THIS" - WEAK SUPERVISION FOR Q-G TAGGING
This project utilizes rules behind the scenes (in this case, law of physics) to help learning models from unlabeled datasets. Very hard and cool stuff, I definitely love it.

Accelerating Fluid Simulations with Neural Networks
Very innovative application of RCNN and LSTM in a different engineering field. Those should bring more insight into those relatively traditional fields!
